      "text": "In my previous post I explained one way to get puppet running on CentOS 4 / RedHat ES-4 using a kickstart. Building from that kickstart, I am going to show how to set up a VirtualBox VM suitable for use with Vagrant. Although I focus on a dated distribution here, these instructions can be applied to other distributions pretty easily. The kickstart can only be used by distributions that support kickstart installations. That means any RedHat or CentOS and possibly others with modifications.\nIf you don't know why you might want to use Vagrant I will briefly explain. Vagrant is a tool that combines virtualization via VirtualBox with configuration management via Puppet and/or Chef to let you create reproducible development environments. You write a Vagrantfile that tells vagrant what your machine should look like and what puppet/chef configurations to apply. This means you don't need to keep a lot of VM's around when they aren't being used. Instead you can re-create the machine with vagrant when you need it, and destroy it when you're done. It has some nice features such as automatic ssh forwarding, optional port forwarding of other services (http for example), and automatic folder sharing. This last one is really nice, as it lets you write an application on your PC with whatever tools you would normally use and automatically have the code available in a VM for testing.\nIn this kickstart I don't provide Chef, although it can be added with gem install chef --no-doc --no-ri if you would like it to be included in your images.\nThe set up\nFor this to work you are going to need the following things on your PC. I will not go into the details of installing VirtualBox or Vagrant, they both have excellent documentation available.\nVirtualBox\nVagrant\nA terminal\nA CentOS / RedHat 4 DVD iso\nA web server, I use Python 2.7 and python -m 'http.server'\nWhen VirtualBox is installed, copy (or link), the VBoxGuestAdditions.iso file into a directory to work in. For linux hosts you can usually find it in /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions, for Mac OS hosts it will be in /Applications/VirtualBox.app/MacOS/. Grab a copy of the latest kickstart from github. Serve these files via http using your favourite web server. I\nuse Python and it's http.server module for Python 2.7 or SimpleHTTPServer for versions < 2.7.\nareid $ cd ~/kickstarts/puppet\npuppet $ ln -s /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso .\npuppet $ wget https://raw.github.com/adamreid/kickstarts/master/puppet-es4-vagrant-ks.cfg\npuppet $ python -m 'http.server'\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...\n\n\n\nThe kickstart\nThis kickstart is an extension of the puppet-es4 with the addition of a few steps to ready it for vagrant and the disabling of a few services that I would consider unnecessary for the VM's intended purpose.\nMost changes here are to conform to the conventions outlined in the Vagrant base box documentation. Specifically:\n The root password is changed to vagrant.\n The vagrant user is added to the admin group.\n The admin group is given passwordless sudo access.\n The vagrant user's .ssh/authorized_keys file contains a known (insecure) key for pubkey authentication.\n* The VirtualBox guest additions are installed.\nA final step is then run to help keep the size of the exported vagrant box down. A file is created in /tmp and filled with 0's until the disk runs out of space, then is deleted. This step is optional. If you are doing repeated testing of the kickstart, this step should be commented out to save time.\n# Kickstart file for Puppet on CentOS 4/RedHat ES-4\n# Tested on ES-4 U8 / CentOS 4.8\n# May work on older enterprise 4 systems.\n#\n# Adam Reid\n# http://github.com/adamreid/kickstarts/puppet-es4-ks.cfg\n\ninstall\ncdrom\nlang en_US.UTF-8\nlangsupport --default=en_US.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\nkeyboard us\nxconfig --card \"VESA driver (generic)\" --videoram 12288 --hsync 31.5-37.9 --vsync 50-70 --resolution 800x600 --depth 16\nnetwork --device eth0 --bootproto dhcp\nrootpw vagrant\nfirewall --disabled\nselinux --disabled\nauthconfig --enableshadow --passalgo=md5\ntimezone --utc America/New_York\nbootloader --location=mbr\n# The following is the partition information you requested\n# Note that any partitions you deleted are not expressed\n# here so unless you clear all partitions first, this is\n# not guaranteed to work\nclearpart --all --drives=sda\npart /boot --fstype ext3 --size=100 --ondisk=sda\npart pv.2 --size=0 --grow --ondisk=sda\nvolgroup VolGroup00 --pesize=32768 pv.2\nlogvol swap --fstype swap --name=LogVol01 --vgname=VolGroup00 --size=512 --grow --maxsize=1024\nlogvol / --fstype ext3 --name=LogVol00 --vgname=VolGroup00 --size=1024 --grow\n\n%packages\nlvm2\nkernel\ne2fsprogs\ngrub\n\n# required to build ruby\n# should be kept for gems that build native extensions.\nautomake\ngcc\ncpp\nglibc-devel\nglibc-headers\nglibc-kernheaders\nglibc\nglibc-common\nlibgcc\n\n# required to build ruby bindings, can be removed after\nzlib-devel\nopenssl-devel\nreadline-devel\n\n%post\n\n# Change to a vt to see progress\n\nexec < /dev/tty3 > /dev/tty3\nchvt 3\n\n# redirect output to ks-post.log including stdout and stderr\n(\n    #######################################################\n    #

Create a new vagrant configuration to test the base image with.\npuppet $ cd ~/vms\nvms $ mkdir es4test\nvms $ cd es4test\nvms $ vagrant init es4base\nvms $ vagrant up\nvms $ vagrant ssh\n\n\n\nThe last command vagrant ssh gives you shell access to the virtual machine you just created. If you look in the machines /vagrant directory you will notice that your Vagrantfile is there. This is a VirtualBox \"shared folder\" that is provided for you by vagrant. The directory it's sharing is the same directory that vagrant init was run inside of in the steps above. \nWhen developing an application you can see how this little convenience will make a big difference in testing your application in a virtual environment. You just create a Vagrantfile with the configuration you require, spin up the VM, and run your application from the shared folder. Keeping the Vagrantfile in source with your application will remind you to keep it up to date as the applications requirements change, and makes it easy for new developers to quickly set up a known-good environment to test in.",

      "text": "This is a short post on how I got Puppet working on CentOS 4.8. Why would I want to do such a thing when there are pre-packaged RPMs available for Centos 5 or 6? Well the company I work for has a massive number of RedHat ES-4 U8 (RedHat ES-4 U8 ~ CentOS 4.8) systems deployed all over the world. I work as part of the \"Software Build and Configuration\" team and we are responsible for setting up systems for QA. Since we use ES-4U8 in production, we must use the same release in QA.\nOne of the goals I've set for myself in my job is to make these QA systems disposable. When QA test these systems they sometimes require specific configuration or data changes to make sure feature X is working and doesn't break feature Y. You can't very well dispose of a system that takes you 1 or 2 days to manually configure, and that's where puppet comes in.\nPuppet (and Chef) allow you to describe the packages, attributes, and configurations that make up a system. They will take a description that you write, called a manifest for puppet and a recipe for chef, and apply changes to a system to make it fit that description. The end result is a reproducible, and therefore disposable, system that can be used for testing a software change.\nUnfortunately on a legacy system such as RedHatES-4 the requirements to run puppet out of the box are not met. Fortunately there is not much that needs to be done to set puppet up, and it can easily be accomplished in a kickstart.\nThe set up\nIn order to run puppet on any system you need Ruby 1.8.5 or 1.8.7 and rubygems. I chose 1.8.7 for performance improvements, and it's compatibility with puppet and chef. In order to build ruby you will need to manually build autconf 2.60 as CentOS 4.8 ships with autoconf 2.59 which won't work. You will also need to make sure that the following packages are installed in your kickstart environment.\nautomake\ngcc\ncpp\nglibc-devel\nglibc-headers\nglibc-kernheaders\nglibc\nglibc-common\nlibgcc\nzlib-devel\nopenssl-devel\nreadline-devel\nThe kickstart\nThis kickstart can be used with CentOS 4 or RedHat 4. It will install a 'minimal system' and the packages required to build Ruby and rubygems. In the %post install section it will download and build autoconf, ruby-1.8.7 and rubygems-1.8.10 then use gem install puppet to install puppet.\n# Kickstart file for Puppet on CentOS 4/RedHat ES-4\n# Tested on ES-4 U8 / CentOS 4.8\n# May work on older enterprise 4 systems.\n#\n# May 5, 2012\n# Adam Reid\n\ninstall\ncdrom\nlang en_US.UTF-8\nlangsupport --default=en_US.UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\nkeyboard us\nxconfig --card \"VESA driver (generic)\" --videoram 12288 --hsync 31.5-37.9 --vsync 50-70 \\\n    --resolution 800x600 --depth 16\nnetwork --device eth0 --bootproto dhcp\n# Password = password\nrootpw --iscrypted $1$7nqqHQSF$/32jwOnJCOiDivVV7o0iw/\nfirewall --disabled\nselinux --disabled\nauthconfig --enableshadow --passalgo=md5\ntimezone --utc America/New_York\nbootloader --location=mbr\n# The following is the partition information you requested\n# Note that any partitions you deleted are not expressed\n# here so unless you clear all partitions first, this is\n# not guaranteed to work\nclearpart --linux --drives=sda\npart /boot --fstype ext3 --size=100 --ondisk=sda\npart pv.2 --size=0 --grow --ondisk=sda\nvolgroup VolGroup00 --pesize=32768 pv.2\nlogvol swap --fstype swap --name=LogVol01 --vgname=VolGroup00 --size=512 --grow --maxsize=1024\nlogvol / --fstype ext3 --name=LogVol00 --vgname=VolGroup00 --size=1024 --grow\n\n%packages\nlvm2\nkernel\ne2fsprogs\ngrub\n\n# required to build ruby\n# should be kept for gems that build native extensions.\nautomake\ngcc\ncpp\nglibc-devel\nglibc-headers\nglibc-kernheaders\nglibc\nglibc-common\nlibgcc\n\n# required to build ruby bindings, can be removed after\nzlib-devel\nopenssl-devel\nreadline-devel\n\n%post --log=/root/ks-post.log\n# Change to a vt to see progress\nchvt 3\n\n# redirect output to ks-post.log including stdout and stderr\n(\n    # Keep it clean\n    mkdir /tmp/ruby\n    cd /tmp/ruby\n\n    # autoconf 2.60 is required to build ruby\n    wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.60.tar.gz\n    tar -xzf autoconf-2.60.tar.gz\n    cd autoconf-2.60\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install\n    cd /tmp/ruby\n\n    # build ruby-1.8.7-p358\n    wget http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p358.tar.bz2\n    tar -xjf ruby-1.8.7-p358.tar.bz2\n    cd ruby-1.8.7-p358\n    autoconf\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install\n    cd /tmp/ruby\n\n    # install ruby-gems 1.8.10\n    wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.8.10.tgz\n    tar -xzf rubygems-1.8.10.tgz\n    cd rubygems-1.8.10\n    /usr/bin/ruby setup.rb\n\n    # clean up\n    cd /\n    rm -rf /tmp/ruby\n\n    # install puppet\n    gem install puppet\n) 2>&1 | tee > /root/ks-post.log\n\n# switch back to gui\nchvt 7\n\n\n\nAnd that's it.

These\nare relative links that point to the Quick reStructuredText user\nreference.  If these links don't work, please refer to the master\nquick reference document.\n\nNote\nThis document is an informal introduction to\nreStructuredText.  The What Next? section below has links to\nfurther resources, including a formal reference.\n\n\nStructure\nFrom the outset, let me say that \"Structured Text\" is probably a bit\nof a misnomer.  It's more like \"Relaxed Text\" that uses certain\nconsistent patterns.  These patterns are interpreted by a HTML\nconverter to produce \"Very Structured Text\" that can be used by a web\nbrowser.\nThe most basic pattern recognised is a paragraph (quickref).\nThat's a chunk of text that is separated by blank lines (one is\nenough).  Paragraphs must have the same indentation -- that is, line\nup at their left edge.  Paragraphs that start indented will result in\nindented quote paragraphs. For example:\n\nThis is a paragraph.  It's quite\nshort.\n\n   This paragraph will result in an indented block of\n   text, typically used for quoting other text.\n\nThis is another one.\n\nResults in:\n\nThis is a paragraph.  It's quite\nshort.\n\nThis paragraph will result in an indented block of\ntext, typically used for quoting other text.\nThis is another one.\n\n\n\nText styles\n(quickref)\nInside paragraphs and other bodies of text, you may additionally mark\ntext for italics with \"*italics*\" or bold with\n\"**bold**\".  This is called \"inline markup\".\nIf you want something to appear as a fixed-space literal, use\n\"``double back-quotes``\".  Note that no further fiddling is done\ninside the double back-quotes -- so asterisks \"*\" etc. are left\nalone.\nIf you find that you want to use one of the \"special\" characters in\ntext, it will generally be OK -- reStructuredText is pretty smart.\nFor example, this lone asterisk * is handled just fine, as is the\nasterisk in this equation: 5*6=30.  If you actually\nwant text *surrounded by asterisks* to not be italicised, then\nyou need to indicate that the asterisk is not special.  You do this by\nplacing a backslash just before it, like so \"\\*\" (quickref), or\nby enclosing it in double back-quotes (inline literals), like this:\n\n``*``\n\n\nTip\nThink of inline markup as a form of (parentheses) and use it\nthe same way: immediately before and after the text being marked\nup.  Inline markup by itself (surrounded by whitespace) or in the\nmiddle of a word won't be recognized.  See the markup spec for\nfull details.\n\n\n\nLists\nLists of items come in three main flavours: enumerated,\nbulleted and definitions.  In all list cases, you may have as\nmany paragraphs, sublists, etc. as you want, as long as the left-hand\nside of the paragraph or whatever aligns with the first line of text\nin the list item.\nLists must always start a new paragraph -- that is, they must appear\nafter a blank line.\nenumerated lists (numbers, letters or roman numerals; quickref)\nStart a line off with a number or letter followed by a period \".\",\nright bracket \")\" or surrounded by brackets \"( )\" -- whatever you're\ncomfortable with.  All of the following forms are recognised:\n\n1. numbers\n\nA. upper-case letters\n   and it goes over many lines\n\n   with two paragraphs and all!\n\na. lower-case letters\n\n   3. with a sub-list starting at a different number\n   4. make sure the numbers are in the correct sequence though!\n\nI. upper-case roman numerals\n\ni. lower-case roman numerals\n\n(1) numbers again\n\n1) and again\n\nResults in (note: the different enumerated list styles are not\nalways supported by every web browser, so you may not get the full\neffect here):\nnumbers\nupper-case letters\nand it goes over many lines\nwith two paragraphs and all!\n\nlower-case letterswith a sub-list starting at a different number\nmake sure the numbers are in the correct sequence though!\n\nupper-case roman numerals\nlower-case roman numerals\nnumbers again\nand again\n\nbulleted lists (quickref)\nJust like enumerated lists, start the line off with a bullet point\ncharacter - either \"-\", \"+\" or \"*\":\n\n* a bullet point using \"*\"\n\n  - a sub-list using \"-\"\n\n    + yet another sub-list\n\n  - another item\n\nResults in:\na bullet point using \"*\"a sub-list using \"-\"yet another sub-list\n\nanother item\n\n\ndefinition lists (quickref)\nUnlike the other two, the definition lists consist of a term, and\nthe definition of that term.  The format of a definition list is:\n\nwhat\n  Definition lists associate a term with a definition.\n\n*how*\n  The term is a one-line phrase, and the definition is one or more\n  paragraphs or body elements, indented relative to the term.\n  Blank lines are not allowed between term and definition.\n\nResults in:\nwhat\nDefinition lists associate a term with a definition.\nhow\nThe term is a one-line phrase, and the definition is one or more\nparagraphs or body elements, indented relative to the term.\nBlank lines are not allowed between term and definition.\n\n\n\nPreformatting (code samples)\n(quickref)\nTo just include a chunk of preformatted, never-to-be-fiddled-with\ntext, finish the prior paragraph with \"::\".  The preformatted\nblock is finished when the text falls back to the same indentation\nlevel as a paragraph prior to the preformatted block.  For example:\n\nAn example::\n\n    Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup\n      (like *this* or \\this) is preserved by literal blocks.\n  Lookie here, I've dropped an indentation level\n  (but not far enough)\n\nno more example\n\nResults in:\n\nAn example:\n\n  Whitespace, newlines, blank lines, and all kinds of markup\n    (like *this* or \\this) is preserved by literal blocks.\nLookie here, I've dropped an indentation level\n(but not far enough)\n\nno more example\n\nNote that if a paragraph consists only of \"::\", then it's removed\nfrom the output:\n\n::\n\n    This is preformatted text, and the\n    last \"::\" paragraph is removed\n\nResults in:\n\nThis is preformatted text, and the\nlast \"::\" paragraph is removed\n\n\n\nSections\n(quickref)\nTo break longer text up into sections, you use section headers.\nThese are a single line of text (one or more words) with adornment: an\nunderline alone, or an underline and an overline together, in dashes\n\"-----\", equals \"======\", tildes \"~~~~~~\" or any of the\nnon-alphanumeric characters = - ` : ' \" ~  _ * + # < > that you\nfeel comfortable with.  An underline-only adornment is distinct from\nan overline-and-underline adornment using the same character.  The\nunderline/overline must be at least as long as the title text.  Be\nconsistent, since all sections marked with the same adornment style\nare deemed to be at the same level:\n\nChapter 1 Title\n===============\n\nSection 1.1 Title\n-----------------\n\nSubsection 1.1.1 Title\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSection 1.2 Title\n-----------------\n\nChapter 2 Title\n===============\n\nThis results in the following structure, illustrated by simplified\npseudo-XML:\n\n<section>\n    <title>\n        Chapter 1 Title\n    <section>\n        <title>\n            Section 1.1 Title\n        <section>\n            <title>\n                Subsection 1.1.1 Title\n    <section>\n        <title>\n            Section 1.2 Title\n<section>\n    <title>\n        Chapter 2 Title\n\n(Pseudo-XML uses indentation for nesting and has no end-tags.  It's\nnot possible to show actual processed output, as in the other\nexamples, because sections cannot exist inside block quotes.  For a\nconcrete example, compare the section structure of this document's\nsource text and processed output.)\nNote that section headers are available as link targets, just using\ntheir name.  To link to the Lists heading, I write \"Lists_\".  If\nthe heading has a space in it like text styles, we need to quote\nthe heading \"`text styles`_\".\n\nDocument Title / Subtitle\nThe title of the whole document is distinct from section titles and\nmay be formatted somewhat differently (e.g. the HTML writer by default\nshows it as a centered heading).\nTo indicate the document title in reStructuredText, use a unique adornment\nstyle at the beginning of the document.  To indicate the document subtitle,\nuse another unique adornment style immediately after the document title.  For\nexample:\n\n================\n Document Title\n================\n----------\n Subtitle\n----------\n\nSection Title\n=============\n\n...\n\nNote that \"Document Title\" and \"Section Title\" above both use equals\nsigns, but are distict and unrelated styles.  The text of\noverline-and-underlined titles (but not underlined-only) may be inset\nfor aesthetics.\n\n\n\nImages\n(quickref)\nTo include an image in your document, you use the the image directive.\nFor example:\n\n.. image:: images/biohazard.png\n\nresults in:\nThe images/biohazard.png part indicates the filename of the image\nyou wish to appear in the document. There's no restriction placed on\nthe image (format, size etc).  If the image is to appear in HTML and\nyou wish to supply additional information, you may:\n\n.. image:: images/biohazard.png\n   :height: 100\n   :width: 200\n   :scale: 50\n   :alt: alternate text\n\nSee the full image directive documentation for more info.\n\n\nWhat Next?\nThis primer introduces the most common features of reStructuredText,\nbut there are a lot more to explore.  The Quick reStructuredText\nuser reference is a good place to go next.  For complete details, the\nreStructuredText Markup Specification is the place to go [1].\nUsers who have questions or need assistance with Docutils or\nreStructuredText should post a message to the Docutils-users mailing\nlist.\n[1]If that relative link doesn't work, try the master document:\nhttp://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html.",

Asterisk, backquote, and vertical bar act\n    like quote marks; matching characters surround the marked-up word\n    or phrase, whitespace or other quoting is required outside them,\n    and there can't be whitespace just inside them. If you want to use\n    inline delimiter characters literally, escape\n    (with backslash) or quote them (with double backquotes; i.e.\n    use inline literals).\n\n    In detail, the reStructuredText specification says that in\n    inline markup, the following rules apply to start-strings and\n    end-strings (inline markup delimiters):\n\n    The start-string must start a text block or be\n    immediately preceded by whitespace or any of\u00a0\n    ' \" ( [ { or\u00a0<.\n    The start-string must be immediately followed by non-whitespace.\n    The end-string must be immediately preceded by non-whitespace.\n    The end-string must end a text block (end of document or\n    followed by a blank line) or be immediately followed by whitespace\n    or any of\u00a0' \" . , : ; ! ? - ) ] } / \\\n    or\u00a0>.\n    If a start-string is immediately preceded by one of\u00a0\n    ' \" ( [ { or\u00a0<, it must not be\n    immediately followed by the corresponding character from\u00a0\n    ' \" ) ] } or\u00a0>.\n    An end-string must be separated by at least one\n    character from the start-string.\n    An unescaped backslash preceding a\n    start-string or end-string will disable markup recognition, except\n    for the end-string of inline literals.\n    Also remember that inline markup may not be nested (well,\n    except that inline literals can contain any of the other inline\n    markup delimiter characters, but that doesn't count because\n    nothing is processed).\n\n    Escaping with Backslashes\n\n    (details)\n\n    reStructuredText uses backslashes (\"\\\") to override the special\n    meaning given to markup characters and get the literal characters\n    themselves.
